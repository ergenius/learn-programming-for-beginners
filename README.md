# LPFB - Learn programming for beginners

Remember! 

- On any subject, search on Google, Youtube & Wikipedia for more information!
- On any subject always read the coresponding wikipedia page (if any) after reading or watching the more accesible content. On wikipedia, the information is presented in a more professional way, using the right academic terms, wich is usefull in jobs interviews if you learn them.
- Create and use a stackoverflow account: https://stackoverflow.com/
- Create and use a git account: https://github.com/
- Create an account & ask ChatGPT about any subject you are interested into: https://chat.openai.com/
- Always search for the latest information. Things are getting obsolete very fast in IT domain. Buy & read books if you like it, but always remember many are obsolete before you buy.
- Read the documentation in English and improve your English language skills.

It is very important to become proficient in searching and finding solutions to your programming questions! Exercise this skill every day.
